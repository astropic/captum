class CAV:

    A Concept Activation Vector (CAV) is a vector orthogonal to the decision
    boundary provided by a classifier to distinguish between activations
    produced by conceptâ€™s examples and random counter concept examples, on one
    layer, as described in the paper:

                        classifier such as CAV weights and accuracies.

                        "weights" is the classifier result and "accs" the
                        classifier training accuracy.
